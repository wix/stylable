# Contributing to Stylable

Howdy! Stylabe is an internal alpha release. We want to see what our Wix colleagues think, gather feedback and improve the proiduct before launching publicly.

There are many ways you can contribute.

## Use Stylable

Try it out. Build something with it (it doesn't matter how small) and let us know what you think. Where are the pain points? What should be easier to do? What did you find most useful? What concepts felt too complex, or too much of an edge-case?


## Help us make better docs

It's a clich√© that open-source projects have terrible documentation. We don't want to be like that! So please tell us about our docs: are they too verbose? Or too terse? What needed more explanation or more examples? Were they organised sensibly?

## Tell us what's missing
What should Stylable be able to do, but currently doesn't? 

## Talk to us!

We have a [public Slack channel](https://wixc3.slack.com/messages/C37ARUEBD/details/) where you can ask for help, or anything else. Alternatively, you can open a [Github issue](https://github.com/wix/stylable/issues). For more lengthy feedback, please email our Product Manager [Arnon Kehat](mailto:arnonk@wix.com). Or, if you're in Tel Aviv, simply come and visit us!

## Shh!

Although the library is Open Source and available publicly, the release is currently only internal, and we would like to keep it that way if possible. Please do not advertise it just yet!
