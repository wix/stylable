## Use Stylable

Try it out. Build something with it (it doesn't matter how small) and let us know what you think. Where are the pain points? What should be easier to do? What did you find most useful? What concepts felt too complex, or too much of an edge-case?

## Help us create better docs

It's a cliché that open-source projects have terrible documentation. We don't want to be one of those! So please tell us about our docs: are they too verbose? Or too terse? What needed more explanation or more examples? Were they organized sensibly?

## Tell us what's missing

What should **Stylable** be able to do, but currently doesn't?

## Talk to us!

We have a [public Slack channel](https://wixc3.slack.com/messages/C37ARUEBD/details/) where you can ask for help, or anything else. Alternatively, you can open a [Github issue](https://github.com/wix/stylable/issues). For more lengthy feedback, please email our Product Manager [Arnon Kehat](mailto:arnonk@wix.com). Or, if you're in Tel Aviv, come on over and visit!
