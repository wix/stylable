# Stylable - CSS for Components

**Stylable** enables you to build reusable, highly-performant components. Each component exposes a style API that maps its internal parts so you can reuse components across teams without sacrificing stylability.

* Scopes styles to components so they don't "leak" and clash with other styles.
* Provides a style API to enable abstracting the internal structure of a component so that it can be styled externally. 
* Uses themes so you can apply a different look and feel to the same components across your web application.
* Enables you to create, reuse and style pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
At build time, the preprocessor converts the **Stylable** CSS into flat, static, valid vanilla CSS that works cross-browser.

## Code Example

*Ido to add really cool code example*

## Installation

Install **Stylable** as a dependency in your local project.

Using npm:
```bash
npm install stylable --save
```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add stylable
```

While the **stylable** package includes a programmatic API and can be used directly, we strongly suggest using
the **stylable-integration** package that powers and enables using the `.st.css` files in your project's build cycle:

## Component Library

**Stylable** includes a rich [component library](https://github.com/wix/stylable-components) for out-of-the-box use.
