# Imports

**Stylable** enables you to import other stylesheets and modules in a way that is similar to [JS Imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import). You can then use the stylesheet or module as it's been defined, or just one or more of its named values, in your own **Stylable** stylesheet.

You use the **Stylable** syntax beginning with `-st-` for the  `:import` config:

 * ```-st-from:``` Identifies the path to the stylesheet or JavaScript module. Can be a relative path or a 3rd party path.
 * ```-st-default:``` Imports the default export of the module named in ```-st-from:```. Use with the name by which to identify the imported value in the scoped stylesheet.
 * ```-st-named:``` List of the named exports to import into the local scoped stylesheet from the file named in ```-st-from:```.

 > Note:
 > * `:import` is a Stylable directive and not a selector.
 > * Using `import` as part of a complex selector or inside a CSS ruleset does not import.
 > * Multiple imports may conflict and the last one in the file wins.

 ## Examples:

#### Import the default export of a local reference stylesheet for use in the scoped stylesheet

Import the ```toggle-button.css``` stylesheet from a local location. Assign the name ```ToggleButton``` to the default export of that stylesheet for use in this scoped stylesheet.

```css
 :import{
    -st-from:"./toggle-button.css";
    -st-default: ToggleButton;
 }
 ```

ES6 equivalent
 ```js
 import ToggleButton from "./toggle-button.css";
 ```

 #### Import named exports from a local JS module

The values ```Gallery``` and ```Menu``` are imported from the local JavaScript module ```my-components```. These named exports are now imported into this scoped stylesheet.

 ```css
 :import{
    -st-from:"./my-components";
    -st-named: Gallery, Menu;
 }
 ```

 ES6 equivalent
 ```js
 import { Gallery, Menu } from "./my-components";
 ```

 #### Import named exports from a local JS module and locally refer to one of the export values as a different name

The values ```Menu``` and ```Gallery``` are imported from the local JavaScript module ```my-components```. `Menu` is used as is and ```Gallery``` has been renamed for use in this scoped stylesheet as ```ProductGallery```. These components should be referred to as ```Menu``` and ```ProductGallery``` in this stylesheet.

 ```css
 :import{
    -st-from:"./my-components";
    -st-named: Menu, Gallery as ProductGallery;
 }
 ```

  ES6 equivalent
 ```js
 import { Menu, Gallery as ProductGallery } from "./my-components";
 ```
