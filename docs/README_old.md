# STYLABLE

**Styable** is a preprocessor that allows you to write style rules for components in CSS syntax, with some native extensions. It scopes styles to components, provides a style API for greater reusability, and uses mixins and variants. At build time **Stylable** converts into flat, static, valid, vanilla CSS that works cross-browser.
