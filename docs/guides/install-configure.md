# Installation

Install **Stylable** as a dependency in your local project.

Using npm:
```bash
npm install stylable --save
```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add stylable
```
The **stylable** package itself contains exported interfaces and constructs for creation, management, resolution, and bundling of style sheets.

While this API can be used directly, we strongly suggest also installing
the **stylable-integration** package that powers integration of `.st.css` files in your project's build cycle:
