# Theme a Component Library

Stylabe allows you to author a [component library](), that can be themed, and easily styled, by its consumers.  

## The `project.st.css` File

We recommend creating a `project.st.css` file in the `src` directory of your component library. This can expose an API for the entire project. Importing this CSS into the theme provides access to all the library's features, enabling you to: 

* Expose all vars in use in the project.
* Import all components, and declare and expose all the [variants](../references/variants.md) of these components.

```css
/* project.st.css */
@namespace "Project";
:vars {
    red1: #F012BE;
    red2: #FF4136;
    grey1: #DDDDDD;
    blue1: #7FDBFF;
    blue2: #0074D9;
}
:import {
    -st-from: './button/button.st.css';
    -st-default: Button;
}
.cancelButton {
    -st-extends: Button;
    -st-variant: true;
    color: value(red2);
}
.submitButton {
    -st-extends: Button;
    -st-variant: true;
    color: value(grey1);
    background: value(blue1);
}
```

## Themable Components

The components in the library should be as easy to style and theme as possible. We recommend following these guidelines when planning: 

* Component authors should expose a good style API and its [custom states](../references/pseudo-classes.md). 
* The API should contain the least possible styling required for the component to function, for example only the layout. (When styling is required as part of the component functionality, it should be explained in a comment and well documented).
* Reusable vars should be declared outside of the component. The component can use vars for common values that are less likely to be override-able. For example, don't define colors in a component.
* Variants should be declared in the main `project.st.css` file, and should not be part of the component code.

## Themable Project Structure

As a best practice we recommend following this folder structure:

* The `src` folder includes the `project.st.css` [file](#the-project-file) that helps theme the library - as described above.
* The `src/components` folder contains a folder for each component, where each component has a **Stylable** CSS file using the naming convention `my-component.st.css`.
* The `src/themes` folder includes the relevant theme files.

```
src/
    project.st.css
    |
    --- components/
    |   --- my-component/
    |       |
    |       index.ts
    |       my-component.tsx
    |       my-component.st.css
    |
    --- themes/
    |   |
    |   backoffice-theme.st.css
    |   frontoffice-theme.st.css
```
## Declaring Vars

One of the primary uses of themes is to standardize styles across an application. [Vars](../references/variables.md) enable you to standardize specific CSS values across the application.

For example, the `.label` CSS class of the `Button` component needs to use the red tone which is used elsewhere in the application theme.

```css
@namespace "Button";
:vars {
    wonderRed: #F012BE;
}
.root {
    background: #b0e0e6;
}
.icon {
    background-image: url(./assets/btnIcon.svg);
}
.label {
    font-size: 16px;
    color: value(red);
}
```

## Applying the Theme to Your Project

In your theme, you import the `project.st.css` and apply theming to it.

The structure of this file is very similar to the `project.st.css`, and sets all values specific to it. 

```css
@namespace "BackofficeTheme";
:vars {
    pink1: #ffb3ff;
    pink2: #ff00ff;
}
:import {
    -st-from: '../components/project.st.css';
    -st-default: Project;
    -st-named: cancelButton, submitButton, horizontalSlider, verticalSlider;
}
.cancelButton {
    background: value(pink1);
}
```
