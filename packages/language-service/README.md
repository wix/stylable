# @stylable/language-service

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@stylable/language-service.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylable/core)

## Overview

The Stylable language service serves as the basis for the [stylable-intelligence](https://github.com/wix/stylable-intelligence) vscode extension. It provides the business logic for resolving code completions, diagnostics, go to definition, syntax highlighting and more.

All CSS language support functionality is also supported (hover hints, inline color picker, etc.). Some CSS diagnostics were removed in order to support custom Stylable syntax.
