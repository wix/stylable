# Completions

The provider provides completion suggestions when a user types a trigger character or manually triggers a completion request.

Trigger charactes are:  "." ":" "-" and " "

In the current examples '|' denotes the user's starting caret position. $1, $2, etc. denote tabstops inside the completion, with $0 being the final cursor position after completion.

## Available Completions

### Top Level Directives

Top level directives are allowed only in the top level of the document.

```css
    :vars{
        $1
    }

Class definition directives are used to add metadata to a CSS class. They are only allowed inside simple selectors*.

Multiple use of the same directive in the same class is not allowed.

    .gaga{
        -st-extends:$1
    }

```css
    .gaga{
        -st-states:$1;
    }
