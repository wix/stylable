This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [@stylable/react-scripts](https://github.com/wix/stylable/tree/master/packages/react-scripts).

`@stylable/react-scripts` has a similar, yet bit different, configuration
and capabilities:
- Uses TypeScript instead of Babel
- Uses Stylable instead of css-loader
- Has no built-in testing setup atm


The original `react-scripts` README with future information is available [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
