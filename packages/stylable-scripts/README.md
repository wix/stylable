# stylable-scripts

A fork of [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts), with the following changes:
- Uses TypeScript instead of Babel, configured to work with Webpack's tree-shaking and dynamic chunks on import();
- Adds built-in support for [Stylable](http://stylable.io/).

# Getting started

This is the quickest way to get a **Stylable** project up and running. It is an opinionated boilerplate that uses TypeScript and **Stylable** instead of css-loader

In your terminal, run:
```
$ npx create-react-app --scripts-version stylable-scripts [APP NAME]
$ cd [APP NAME]
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
