There are currently two options for installing and working with **Stylable** as described in the following sections.

## Create a new Stylable project from a boilerplate

To begin writing your own project, you can create a **Stylable** app from our boilerplate. It is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To create the project, follow these instructions: 

Using npm:
```bash
npx create-react-app --scripts-version @stylable/react-scripts [APP NAME]
```

For the `[APP NAME]` placeholder above, replace with the name of your project. Once you run the command, a directory with that same name is created. Go to that directory and run `yarn`, followed by `yarn start` to view the project in a browser, or `yarn build` to build your project's target code.

The project includes several basic components and **Stylable** stylesheets which have the suffix `.st.css`. 

## Install Stylable to work with an existing project

To work with an existing `webpack` based project, you can install [Stylable](https://github.com/wix/stylable) and the [@stylable/webpack-plugin](https://github.com/wix/stylable/tree/master/packages/webpack-plugin) packages from our GitHub repositories. 

Install **Stylable** and the **@stylable/webpack-plugin** as a dependency in your local project.

Using npm:
```bash
npm install stylable @stylable/webpack-plugin --save-dev
```
Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn add stylable @stylable/webpack-plugin --dev
```

## Write in Stylable

Once you've installed either the boilerplate or the packages into your own project, you can begin writing in **Stylable**. Look through the [Specifications Reference](./cheatsheet.md) for specs and code examples. 

To take advantage of code completion and diagnostics, install [**Stylable Intelligence**](./stylable-intelligence.md) currently supported for only Visual Studio Code.

## Build configuration

Currently we support Webpack as our build system. To author a component library, use our CLI tool to build each CSS separately.

Add **Stylable** to your Webpack configuration as follows: 

```js
const StylableWebpackPlugin = require('@stylable/webpack-plugin');
...
{
    module: {
        rules: [
        {
            test: /\.(png|jpg|gif)$/,
            use: [
            {
                loader: "url-loader",
                options: {
                    limit: 8192
                }
            }
            ]
        }
        ]
    }
    plugins: [
        new StylableWebpackPlugin()
    ]
}
```

For more information on configuring the @stylable/webpack-plugin, see the [readme file](https://github.com/wix/stylable/tree/master/packages/webpack-plugin).

## Types

TypeScript requires to be made aware of Stylable in order to provide typings and module resolution for `*.st.css` files. To do this, create a `globals.d.ts` file in your `./src` directory and add the following declaration.

```js
declare module '*.st.css' {
    const stylesheet: import('@stylable/runtime').RuntimeStylesheet;
    export default stylesheet;
}
```

If your project TypeScript version is below `2.9` and does not support [import type](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/05/31/announcing-typescript-2-9/#import-types), copy the following snippet into your `globals.d.ts` file.

```js
type StateValue = boolean | number | string;

interface StateMap {
    [stateName: string]: StateValue;
}

interface AttributeMap {
    className?: string;
    [attributeName: string]: StateValue | undefined;
}

interface InheritedAttributes {
    className?: string;
    [props: string]: any;
}

type RuntimeStylesheet = {
    (className: string, states?: StateMap, inheritedAttributes?: InheritedAttributes): AttributeMap
    $root: string,
    $namespace: string,
    $depth: number,
    $id: string | number,
    $css?: string,

    $get(localName: string): string | undefined;
    $cssStates(stateMapping?: StateMap | null): StateMap;
} & { [localName: string]: string };

declare module '*.st.css' {
    const stylesheet: RuntimeStylesheet;
    export default stylesheet;
}
```
