title: Create a Stylable Component Library
layout: docs
---

We are now experimenting with a new [component library](https://github.com/wix/stylable-components) based on **Stylable** and React. It is in the **early development stages** and will be available soon. Here are some guidelines we gathered related to this project that you may be interested in following if you build your own library.

**Stylable** enables you to author a component library, that can be themed, and easily consumed and styled, by other **Stylable** projects.  

**Stylable** is the styling, CSS side of working with components. For the **Stylable** CSS to be fully useful, it must integrate with a component library from another source, for example React.

## Recommended folder structure

As a best practice, we recommend following this folder structure:

```
src/
    |
    --- components/
    |   |
    |   --- my-component/
    |   |   |
    |   |   my-component.jsx
    |   |   my-component.st.css
    |   |
    |   project.st.css
    |
    --- themes/
    |   |
    |   backoffice-theme.st.css
    |   app-theme.st.css
```

* The `src/components` folder contains:
    * a project stylesheet describing the project CSS API
    * a folder for each component with its stylable stylesheet
* The `src/themes` folder contains the relevant theme files.

> **Note:** Although you may think the project file should be at the `src` level, we recommend you to create the `project.st.css` file at the same level as your components because there are many links between this file and your component files.

## The `project.st.css` file

As a first step, create a [project commons stylesheet](./project-commons.md) named `project.st.css` in the `src/components` directory. This exposes the API for the project. 

> **Note**:
> It is recommended to leave the project's CSS rulesets empty with no declarations. These should be defined in a theme file. 

## Customizable components

Your components should be as easy to style as possible. We recommend following these guidelines when planning: 

* Expose a good style API and its [custom states](../references/pseudo-classes.md). 
* The component API should contain the minimum styling required for the component to function. For example some components may require layout. 
* The effect of CSS combinations is not always easy to understood and styles are generally less tested, therefore, we recommend adding comments that explain the reason for unclear CSS.
* Reusable [vars](../references/variables.md) should be declared outside of the component. The component can use vars for common values that are less likely to be override-able.
* Use [component variants](./component-variants.md) and [shared classes](./shared-classes.md) from the project file (`project.st.css`).


More best practices for themable components can be found in the [**Stylable** component best practices guide](./stylable-component-best-practices.md).

In the following code, you can see a component described with:
* 2 colors used from project
* 1 shared class 

```css
/* app.st.css */
@namespace "App";
:import {
    -st-from: '../project.st.css';
    -st-named: color1, color2, emphasisBox;
}
.root {
    color: value(color1);
    background: value(color2);
}
.messageBox {
    /* append emphasisBox CSS class to messageBox JS output */
    -st-extends: emphasisBox;
}
```

## Theme

The **Stylable** library can include multiple theme files that render a different look and feel per theme. A theme imports the `project.st.css` file as [theme](../references/theme.md) to override variables, variants and classes from the library.

In the following code, you can see a theme file customizing the library:
* override `color1` and `color2`
* CSS for `cancelButton` variant component
* CSS for `emphsisBox` shared class

```css
/* backoffice-theme.st.css */
@namespace "backofficeTheme";
:import {
    -st-from: '../project.st.css';
    -st-named: color1, color2, cancelButton, emphasisBox;
    color1: white;
    color2: red;
}
.cancelButton {
    color: value(color1);
    background: value(color2);
}
.emphasisBox {
    border: 3px solid value(color2);
}
```
