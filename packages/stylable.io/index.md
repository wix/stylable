At [Wix](https://www.wix.engineering/), we &hearts; CSS. Its simple, declarative syntax that is native in browsers is easily the fastest way to add styles to web pages and web apps. But when writing CSS that is scoped to individual components, developers have to maintain highly-specific selectors, using elaborate conventions to fake namespacing. Writing and maintaining CSS across large teams and large projects can be tricky.

We also &hearts; TypeScript. TypeScript helps us manage these large projects, exposing at build-time what we could once only see at run-time. 

We want to give CSS a _type system_ &mdash; to do for CSS what TypeScript does for JavaScript. We would like to be able to:

* **Extend CSS** so that it is easier to use in a component ecosystem, but without losing any of the declarative, familiar, static and fast aspects of CSS. 
* Create **CSS Macros** with JavaScript and use them at build time.
* Use language services like **Code Completion** and **Validation**. Each component exposes a Style API that maps its internal parts and states so you can reuse components across teams without sacrificing stylability or scalability.
* Provide the ability to see our **errors at build** time or even while [working in our IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.stylable-intelligence). Wave goodbye to silent run-time breakage misery!

So we created **Stylable** &mdash; a CSS preprocessor that enables you to write style rules in CSS syntax, with some extensions that we believe adhere to the spirit of CSS.

## What Does Stylable Do?

* **Stylable** scopes styles to components so they don’t "leak" and clash with other styles.
* **Stylable** enables custom pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements that abstract the internal state and structure of a component. These can then be styled externally. For example, you can style the label inside a button, or style the play button of a video player from outside these components.
* At build time, the preprocessor converts the **Stylable** CSS into flat, static, valid, vanilla CSS that works cross-browser.

## Tooling

![Stylable Intelligence](./images/intelligence.gif)

Treating CSS as a type system opens up a whole new world of tooling. You can: 
* Get code completion that hints at the internal structure of components. 
* Get types for your parameters.
And so much more. 

**Stylable** enhances the styling development process.

To get the full **Stylable** experience, install our [VSCode Code Completion Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.stylable-intelligence). It supports code completions, diagnostics, go to definitions, syntax highlighting and more.

## Shut up and take my money!

No need! **Stylable** is BSD-licensed. Take it, use it, make your development easier and your apps faster.

Viva CSS, and welcome **Stylable**. We hope you like it.
