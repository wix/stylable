## What is Stylable

**Stylable** enables you to build reusable, highly-performant components. Each component exposes a style API that maps its internal parts so you can reuse components across teams without sacrificing stylability.

* Scopes styles to components so they don't "leak" and clash with other styles.
* Enables custom pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements that abstract the internal structure of a component. These can then be styled externally.
* Uses themes so you can apply different look and feel across your web application.

At build time, the preprocessor converts the Stylable CSS into flat, static, valid, vanilla CSS that works cross-browser.

## How do I install

1. Install **Stylable** from our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/wix/stylable).

2. Install the **Stylable** [integrations package](https://github.com/wix/stylable-integration).

3. While **Stylable** can work with any component framework, we use it with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html). 

## What can I do

* **Build a Stylable component** - If you are looking to style a component, follow the steps in the [Stylable Basics Guide](../docs/guides/components-basics.md) and [Best Practices Guide](../docs/guides/stylable-component-best-practices.md)

* **Build an app** - If you want to use **Stylable** while building a web application, go to [Build a Stylable Application](../docs/guides/stylable-application.md). Read the steps and recommendations for building a performant web application that doesn't depend on other libraries for styling.

* **Create a library** - If you want guidance in creating a component library, read [Create a Stylable Component Library](../docs/guides/stylable-component-library.md). Here you can follow our recommendations for building a library that can be used cross-project and includes theming, external styling and reusable components.

* **Learn** - Take a look at our reference documents to get more acquanted with our code and for specific code examples.

* **Remember** - Our [cheatsheet](../docs/getting-started/cheatsheet.md) helps you keep track of **Stylable** syntax.


## Components

We recommend using our component library, [**Stylable-Components**](https://github.com/wix/stylable-components) - a stylable, fully-tested & strictly-typed component library.
