Install **Stylable** as a dependency in your local project.

Using npm:
```bash
npm install stylable --save
```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add stylable
```
While the stylable package includes a programmatic API and can be used directly, we strongly suggest also installing
the [stylable-integration package](https://github.com/wixplosives/stylable-integration) that powers the integration of `.st.css` files in your project's build cycle.
