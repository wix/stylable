Every Stylable stylesheet has a reserved class called `root` that matches the root node of the component. 

You can apply default styling and behavior to the component on the root class itself.

## Examples

The `root` class is added automatically to root in [react integration](react-integration.md). No need to write `className="root"`.

```css
/* CSS */
@namespace "Comp";
.root { background: red; } /* set component background to red */
```

```css
/* CSS output*/
.Comp__root { background: red; }
```

> **Note**    
> Root can also define [states](./pseudo-classes) and [extend another component](./extend-stylesheet.md).
