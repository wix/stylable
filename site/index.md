![Stylable - CSS for Components](/images/96-logo-horizontal.png){: .center-image }

**Stylable** enables you to build reusable, highly-performant components. Each component exposes a style API that maps its internal parts so you can reuse components across teams without sacrificing stylability.

* Scopes styles to components so they don't "leak" and clash with other styles.
* Enables custom pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements that abstract the internal structure of a component. These can then be styled externally.
* Uses themes so you can apply different look and feel across your web application.

At build time, the preprocessor converts the **Stylable** CSS into flat, static, valid vanilla CSS that works cross-browser.
